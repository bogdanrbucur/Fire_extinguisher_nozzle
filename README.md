# Fire extinguisher nozzle
3D model of a fire extinguisher plastic nozzle used to direct the extinguishing medium

Fire extinguisher nozzle I designed in Autodesk 123D Design for a IdeaWerk REALvision 3D printer on board a vessel. Multiple fire extinguishers on board the vessel were missing the fire nozzle used to direct the extinguishing medium and as the vessel was part of a pilot program to implement 3D printing on board ships within the fleet, I took the opportunity to design and 3D print the nozzles, thus saving spare parts costs. The vessel still uses these nozzles to this day.

The model includes supports to hold the nozzle as it gets 3D printed and is designed to be printed with the nozzle orifice down. After printing, the model requires manual thread making so it can be fitted on the fire extinguishers triggers.
